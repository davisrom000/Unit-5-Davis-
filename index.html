<h1>Headers</h1>
<p>Headers are used to create page titles and section headers. There are six different sizes pre-formatted for HTML.</p>
<h1>h1 - Computer Science</h1>
<h2>h2 - Computer Science</h2>
<h3>h3 - Computer Science</h3>
<h4>h4 - Computer Science</h4>
<h5>h5 - Computer Science</h5>
<h6>h6 - Computer Science</h6>

<h1>Text Formatting</h1>
<p>There are three types of text formatting. Those are: <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

<h2>Inline vs. Block Elements</h2>
<p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and headers elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> keeps its content on the same line as the content before it and after it. It does NOT create a new line. The bold, italics and underline elements are inline elements.</p>

<h3><u>Block Example</u></h3>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is another paragraph. It makes a new block.</p><p>This is an example of a nested block element. <p>This is a nested block.</p></p>

<h3><u>Inline Elements Examples</u></h3>
<p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element does not move to a new line.</p>

<h2>Vertical Spacing</h2>
<p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> moves the content down to a new line. Its similar to the <i>ENTER</i> key in Word/Docs. A horizontal rule is a line break which includes a horizontal bar across the page. Both are block elements.</p>

<p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>

<p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
<p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
